# üåç Global Population Distribution Analysis - Data Science Internship Project üöÄ

I‚Äôm excited to share my first task as a **Data Science Intern** at **Prodigy InfoTech**! This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the **global population distribution**, revealing interesting trends and insights using **histograms**, **bar charts**, and a **dashboard**.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, I explored the population distribution across continents and how it has evolved over time. Below are the key findings and visualizations that helped uncover important global demographic insights.

### Key Insights:
- **Asia** leads with over **60%** of the world‚Äôs population, making it the most populous continent.
- **Africa** accounts for **17.89%** of the population, showing significant growth.
- **Europe** holds **9.32%**, while **North America** accounts for **7.53%** and **South America** for **5%**.
- **Oceania** (including Australia) makes up **0.56%** of the global population.

### Fascinating Trends:
- **Africa's Population Growth**: 
  - In 1980, Africa‚Äôs population was **15.59%** of the global total, which decreased to **13.32%** in 2000. However, the population rebounded strongly, reaching **17.89%** by 2022.
  
## Visualizations

To present these insights clearly, I used the following visualizations:
- **Histograms**: Showcased the distribution of population by continent.
- **Bar Charts**: Highlighted population percentages for each continent across different time periods.
- **Dashboard**: Created an interactive dashboard that displays the top 5 most densely populated countries in each continent.
